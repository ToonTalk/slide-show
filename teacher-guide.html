<p>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The importance of artificial Intelligence in society, the workplace, and the economy is rapidly increasing.
It is becoming an important part of many other technologies. AI conversational agents are becoming common in phones and PCs (Siri, Cortana, OK Google).
Driverless vehicles are coming soon.
Finance, medicine, and many other fields are relying more and more on AI.
Even toys are beginning to embed AI.</p>

<p>Is there something to learn about intelligence in general by studying AI?
AI researchers attempts to give computers the abilities to perceive, to solve problems, and to reason
shed light on intelligence beyond what studying human and animal psychology can.</p>

<p>AI raises many questions:</p>
<ul><li>What is the future of work?</li></ul>
<li>How dangerous is AI?</li>
<li>How to ensure AIs make ethical choices?</li>
<li>Would you want a robot to be your child’s best friend?</li>
<h3>Ways of teaching AI</h3>
<p>Broadly there are three approaches</p>
<ol><li>Readings, lectures, and discussions about AI’s history, ideas, and technologies</li>
<li>Readings, lectures, and discussions about social issues impacted by AI</li>
<li>Supporting hands-on experiences creating AI apps and artefacts</li></ol>

<p>While this guide touches on 1 and 2 and its focus is on 3.While some aspects of building AI applications are best suited for those with phds in the field,
there are many projects that even young school students can do.
If the power of speech and image recognition or the possibilities of machine learning are given easy programming interfaces
then even beginners can use them in their creations.</p>
<h3>Speech output</h3>
<p>Let's start by exploring speech synthesis.
Is the ability to transform text into spoken speech really an example of AI?
Humans need to spend a long time learning to read (out loud).
But reading involves character recognition and spelling as well as comprehension.
When a computer produces speech none of that is involved. Before discussing what is involved in synthesising speech let’s look at how it can be used by students.</p>
